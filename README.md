## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

first of all it taught me how to use a custom font 

```css
@font-face{
    font-family: Figtree-Medium;
    src: url(assets/fonts/static/Figtree-Medium.ttf);  
}
```
then also about the hover and also the border width of different sides to be different

### Continued development

Yet i don't have full control over the flex styling i would be focusing on that
